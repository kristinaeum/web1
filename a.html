We wish you a merry Christmas
We <strong>wish</strong> you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year

<p style="margin-top:50px;">You say that I'm messing with your head
All 'cause I was making out with your friend
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop 'cause I'm having too much fun</p>




And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good
But, now what the hell
What? What? What? What the hell?
So, what if I go out on a million dates
You never call or listen to me anyway
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play
You're on your knees
Begging, "Please, stay with me"
But,…
